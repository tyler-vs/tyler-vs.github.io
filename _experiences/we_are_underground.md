As a front-end developer and support specialist, I debug and enhance Shopify themes, adding new features and fixing bugs to improve the user experience. I also resolve merchant issues via email, providing technical support and stylistic customizations, while occasionally contributing to the theme's GitHub repository. Through this, I have gained extensive knowledge of the Shopify platform, its APIs, and the Liquid templating language, in addition to writing technical documentation for theme features.
