Developing HTML based emails for client promotions.

<!--more-->

### What I did

Create HTML emails for email-based promotions.

### Project's Biggest Challenge

HTML emails are unique in that they are not built the same way as websites are despite them using HTML. Crafting HTML emails requires using the table element, and a lot of CSS that can be used on web page cannot be used in creating HTML-based emails.

I also learned along the way, that HTML emails have a whole bunch of rules to adhere to, just to properly display in each email vendor.

### What I took away

The importance of HTML tables in HTML email design also some general rules to adhere to when developing for HTML emails. LAter on I would learn about HTML boilerplate code available and tools such as Zurb's Ink which help the process of streamlining HTML email development.
