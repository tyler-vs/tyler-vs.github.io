## What I did

Build HTML Emails for client email marketing promotions.

## Project's Biggest Challenge

This project was one of my first web developer tasks, and so I did _not_ really know about development tools and build processes to help when it comes to HTML email development. So when building the email's HTML template, I had to get re-acquainted with HTML tables. 

I also learned along the way, that HTML emails have a whole bunch of rules to adhere to, just to properly display in each email vendor.

## What I took away

The importance of HTML tables in HTML email design also some general rules to adhere to when developing for HTML emails.
