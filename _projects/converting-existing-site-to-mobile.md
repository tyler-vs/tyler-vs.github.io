### What I did

Converting an existing non responsive website to be responsive for mobile devices. Set up tools that would auto refresh the site while media query styles were added to it.

This project was done around Spring/Summer 2016

### Project's Biggest Challenge

Modifying existing CSS code with added Media queries to convert the site to display on mobile. Accounting for all of the different layouts used on the site to become mobile responsive.

### What I took away

The importance of designing mobile first and difficulties encountered when retrofitting an existing CSS code base to work on mobile devices.

This project is no longer viewable on the web, the site has been updated to use a different WordPress theme.
