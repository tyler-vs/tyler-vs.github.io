Recently I have updated my personal site's design and decided to use an existing theme rather than build one from scratch, here are some thoughts and insights on the decision.

- content first
- areas of knowledge as a front end developer
- child themes

I have had a Jekyll powered site ever since college, while in between learning about version control and having to make a portfolio website as a class project, a Jekyll powered site was discovered and became a wonderful match for my needs. It was great learning about it, I could also tangentially learn about git too while creating a site. Bootstrap was very popular and many of my peers were able to create nice looking portfolio sites using that, when projects were reviewed near the end of the course, the professor asked me on why my site didn't look as nice, my answer was that the beauty was finding a tool that was free. The many iterations of my site since then sadly did not improve much and just recently I decided to re-approach the issue. 

## areas of knowledge as a front end developer

Front-end developers are usually associated with making things look great, while that is part of the role however the role as a modern front-end developer is much more than CSS. While many of my peers were able to create beautiful websites using CSS I was not discouraged because while they were good in one area of front-end development I was good in others. They could produce better looking sites however in other areas, such as using APIs to create a Twitter bot I was able to excel. 

## content first approach

Another difficulty that I was always encountering with the portfolio site is that I developed the layouts of the site too soon, even before having any content to populate it - in fact content was a secondary thought and so was a reason my site suffered. Without quality content I would have site layouts and features which looked good but did little in enriching the site or drawing in visitors. My decision to use Hyde was the revelation that content should go first and the Hyde theme was great at making content look good and readable for viewers.

### Writing more content and going for "good enough" over "perfect"

With the decision to have content first came also hopes to enforce another decision, which it to write about things more often and when they are fresh in mid. Even if it is hastily written at first, it is better to have something going rather than have spend a bulk of time into fine tuning which may go into a perfectionists purgatory state. [Similar sentiments have been thought before](https://michaelsoolee.com/good-enough-better-than-perfect/).

## child themes inspiration and modular approach

Hyde, if it was not already known, was developed by the creator to Twitter Bootstrap so the code is beautiful and acts as a great starting point if wanting to extend it with more features and layouts. My fear is that others will think the site design was completely made by me, which it is not, instead I stand and learn the theme code from individuals who are regarded as the best in the industry, hopefully seen by them as the best form of compliment - emulating.

When building a site from scratch, there are a lot of pieces to juggle, especially if trying to add many features at once and trying to finish a blog theme in one sitting (which I do not recommend) making it unpolished and not easy to use elsewhere. The Hyde theme came with just the basics, that way it can be extended in a modular way or even like how child themes are used on WordPress.
