Hi, my name is Tyler Van Schaick. I'm a support developer at [We Are Underground](https://weareunderground.com) where I assist merchants who are using our Shopify themes and I also dabble in Shopify theme development. I have been a support developer since November 2019 and a front-end developer before then.

I use this site as a portfolio site and occasionally make blog posts related to front-end development, personal musings and Shopify tips and tricks that I come across.

## About the site

The site uses the [Hyde theme](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) built by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) and is used as a starting point from which I have extended with some custom modifications.
